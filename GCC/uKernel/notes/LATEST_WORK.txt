Try to initialize 2 tasks and then execute context switch..
Remember, Context restore part needs to be implemented. We left in the place were the SP is returned from new task stack
1) added svc 0 and svc handler for jumping indirectly to context_switch
2) use different names for context_switch that raises the exception and switch that handles the context switch
3) look for link register to jump to after the stack is restored..

almost there....
