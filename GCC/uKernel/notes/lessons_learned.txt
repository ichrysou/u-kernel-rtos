Bug reports for porting to GCC:
1) VTOR = 0x10000000 when debugging in RAM
  No start_os was possible because VTOR value was chang3ed by 
  startup routine and the reference to g_pfnVectors was wrong.Thas
  why I re-set VTOR  to 0x10000000 before start_os

2) context_switch must be naked. 
   Otherwise assembly code for enter and exit of the function will
   cause register-context corrutpion
3) PendSV must have the same or lower interrupt priority than SysTick.
   Otherwise the PesnSV handler is executed from within interrupt context. This 
   we don't want beacuse of  the stuipid gcc assembly instructions that are
   entered after the end fof SystTickhandler whcih corrupt our ffreshly 
   restoered contesxt.
